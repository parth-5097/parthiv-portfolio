# Parthiv's Portfolio

## How To Use 

From your command line, clone and run developerFolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/parth-5097/parthiv-portfolio.git

# Go into the repository
cd parthiv-portfolio

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start a local dev server
npm start
```

## Linking Portfolio to GitHub

Generate a classic GitHub personal access token following these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) (make sure you don't select any scope just generate a simple token). If you are using [GitHub Actions](#configuring-github-actions-recommended) to deploy your portfolio you can skip this section.

1. Create a file called .env in the root directory of your project (if not done already in section: [How To Use](#how-to-use))

Note: Configuring environment variables before deploying your portfolio is highly recommended as some components depend on API data. 

```bash
- DeveloperFolio
  - node_modules
  - public
  - src
  - .env         <-- create it here
  - .gitignore
  - package-lock.json
  - package.json
```

#### Configuring GitHub Actions (Recommended)
First you should enable, GitHub Actions for the repository you use.

The Profile and the Repository information from GitHub is only created at the time of deploy and the site needs to be redeployed if those information needs to be updated. So, a configurable [CRON Job](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events) is setup which deploys your site every week, so that once you update your profile on GitHub it is shown on your portfolio. You can also trigger it manually using `workflow_dispatch` event, see [this guide](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch) on how to do that.

- When you are done with the configuration, we highly recommend to read through the [GitHub Actions Configuring a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow) docs.

#### Deploying to GitHub Pages

This section guides you to deploy your portfolio on GitHub pages.

- Navigate to `package.json` and enter your domain name `https://<your-username>.github.io/parthiv-portfolio`.

- Now add variable `Public_URL` to set as same domain name.

- Add `predeploy` and `deploy` as `npm run build` and `gh-pages -d build`. Also, don't forgot to install gh-pages package as npm package. 

- Now just run `npm run deploy`.

- Follow through the guide to setup GitHub pages from the official CRA docs [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).
